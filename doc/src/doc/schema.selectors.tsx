            <p>
                Selector are important concept and they are used in many way.
                Each property have a selector assigned to it that can be used as
                reference to this property. Just remember that selectors are
                automatically generated based from position in the schema using
                dot notation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Selectors will become handy later with validation and
                qualifications and form instance:
            </p>
            <CodeBlock
                height={"380px"}
                value={`const schema: Schema = {
    __: {
        address: {
            type: "object",
            __: {
                street: { type: "string" },
                city: { type: "string" },
                location: {
                    type: "object",
                    __: {
                        lat: { type: "number" },
                        lng: { type: "number" }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }            
}`}
            />
            Here the selectors of answerable properties of the example above:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>address.street</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>address.city</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>address.location.lat</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>address.location.lng</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </>
    );
}
